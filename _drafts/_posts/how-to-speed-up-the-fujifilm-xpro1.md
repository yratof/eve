content: 'This is my go to camera. mostly because I can''t afford the update to the
  xpro2, but mostly because it''s a solid camera that outperforms so many cameras
  in terms of quality of image produced.the one thing that has always got me though
  is the speed of the thing. THere are times when I think that the cameras auto focus
  is too slow, or that there''s a strange delay between taking a picture and pushing
  the shutter button. '
