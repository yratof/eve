## Custom artist centric brushes for procreate

I'm a fan of proceate. I sold all my Cintiq's, bought an iPad and hit the road.
On this road though, I realised that I needed some brushes. So I made a few.

Now I'm constantly developing more and more brushes and adding them to a long list of 'artist brushes for procreate'.
This means that this journey has no end in sight, so please download them, play with them and show me what you can do!
If you email me your pictures, I'll post them on here ❤️
