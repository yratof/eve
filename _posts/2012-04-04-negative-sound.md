<p>One piano, one synth, one electric guitar, one Spanish guitar, two acoustic guitars and a bass.</p>
<p>No I didn't think I had enough either.</p>
<p>So today I brought home a <strong>violin</strong>. Its cheap and old, but it's what I'll use before I buy that beautiful black one I saw when <em>not</em> shopping online for hours trying to find one...</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, violin is hard. It's so fiddley(pun?), so delicate and completely alien to me, the way you hold the body so that your supporting it, but not holding it, your hand moves freely around the fretless, markerless neck...</p>
<p>It's strange, to not able to pick up an instrument and know how to play it after a few moment figuring out where the notes you need are. I can pick out melodies with my ear and almost instantly translate that to a guitar... I realise now that I know where the next note goes because I'm presented with a limited amount of options. A or A#. D or Db. There are set notes for me to pick from, however, violins aren't designed that way, you could play Indian Demi tones with one, so the guessing game is taken to a whole new level.</p>
<p>It must be technique, a way to know where to start and how many fingers away an F is. Practise on my own, or take lessons, that's what I'm wondering now though...</p>
<p>What would you recommend?</p>
