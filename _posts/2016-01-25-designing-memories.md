I'm a creative guy, to which i've never been one to create something specifically without a purpose other than being creative. But recently, I've been looking back at all the media from my childhood, or should I say, the lack of it.

From what I remember about my childhood, there were pictures, there were cameras and there was footage – specifically, I remember being extremely embarrased while being filmed on the toilet.

But where are they now? Lost to time and the lack of redundencies. Video tape, if not looked after, would naturally degrade over time, and with the size and bulk of them, they often didn't make it though the travelling and moving process.
