Can’t remember your memories? Having trouble recalling an event? Well this is where I come in to play. My services are not unique on their own, but they are combined.
I provide you with a video of any point of your life, heck, if you’re willing to pay the subscription, you can have most of your life digitised.

Once you sign the contract, I’ll pay you a visit within 168 hours. Following this, your videos will be dropped into a secure cloud system and the details will be passed over to you.

There are a few things I should mention before we start… I can’t help you if you’ve had any accidents, I’m only good with non-damaged minds. I also have no interest in your perverted thoughts. I’m not to be hired by governments to find terrorists or possible terrorists or the suggestion of a memory tying any criminal activity together.
