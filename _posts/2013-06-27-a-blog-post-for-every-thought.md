<p>It always starts the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm gonna write a blog post... Damn, the site looks dated, I'll quickly redesign it </p></blockquote>
<p>5 hours later, this page looks a little different, but the content remains the same. </p>
<p>I do this several times a year, and I'm always left with this belief that I've actually done something with this blog. I'm not even sure of the point of my thoughts here at the moment, which genre I should categorise in, it's a mixture of my thoughts and my learning, but I want to write in a less formal way than a tutorial.</p>
<p>Gists and techniques that might help someone might be better of in a wiki... An idea that hopefully I'll follow through with and develop something I can reuse to help clients out, especially with email issues. With every problem found, if it's documented and posted on there, less time is needed to repeat this process.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm in between thoughts and ideas, I've got domains with dust on em and I've got projects to fulfil. I've got physical projects ongoing also, with me signing up for a cycle to Paris recently, most of my weekend is spent sat down peddling for hours upon on end...</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I'll update the look of the site actually...</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this time I'll mean it? I'm thinking I change the header image to a featured image relating to the post at hand. And include an archive of some kind, no point in having just the one post is there? Depending on how I use this site, maybe it could be short snippets of thoughts, to be linked from a social network? People don't stumble upon the site and browse, it could be used as more of a branded thought...</p>
<p>I'll let me know in the morning.</p>
