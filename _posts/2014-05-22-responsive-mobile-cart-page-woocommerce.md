<p>This has been bugging me for a while. I've put together a quick gist for a mobile cart page on woocommerce. Now this currently works for WooCommerce 2.1.9, and no doubt it'll change as I develop it, but if you use this (written in scss) you'll find your mobile cart page working nicer when you view it on the go.</p>
