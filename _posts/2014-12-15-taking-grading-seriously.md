<p>I'm going to get technical on this post, so deal with it...</p>
<p>Ever since the <a title="Magic Lantern" href="http://www.magiclantern.fm/" target="_blank">ML</a> on my 550d could film RAW, I've always wanted to play around with it, see what I can pull out of the images...</p>
<p>Then Black Friday hit. Thank you, you silly American holiday. $500 for a new Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera</p>
