<p>On Thursday, I had an idea to create a quick visual of the queen having a cupcake from <a title="Lick That Bowl Cupcakery" href="http://www.lickthatbowl.com" target="_blank">lick that bowl</a>.</p>
<p>A very simple idea, a cupcake and a cup of tea on a table, with a short depth of field, the queen sat at the end of the table, (<em>the DOF causing her to not be in focus, so that way I don't break some sort of law).</em></p>
<p>All i had to do was get a few images together, composite them in cinema4d and viola!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-42" title="The Queen Enjoying a Vanilla cupcake from Lick that Bowl" src="/assets/imgs/queen-tea.jpg" alt="The Queen Enjoying a Vanilla cupcake from Lick that Bowl" width="1200" height="720" /></p>
<p>Behind the render files after the break</p>
