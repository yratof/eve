<p>The way I've handled clients and content recently has been quite an eye opener. The amount of projects I start without content, without knowing what pages i'm creating, confuses me at the best of times.</p>
<p>I've always liked the idea of content first, but i'm unsure with what I need to do to start a project with actual content. Maybe the blame isn't to fall upon me, but on the clients who feel like they need to get in touch for a website, before they've got an idea of what they want.</p>
<p>What if we took a different approach to collecting information from clients? Instead of thinking in "pages", we thought in text, in content. we take everything, all the information, and then we create a website around that? I know that is ultimately what "content first" is, but the way we take this information from clients might be the key to a successful design project.</p>
