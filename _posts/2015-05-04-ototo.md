  tl;dr: <a href="http://ototo.fm">Ototo</a> is a keyboard that can double up as a
    Midi controller that can power so many projects, word cannot adequately describe
    them here.

<p>I finally purchased an <a href="http://ototo.fm" target="_blank">Ototo</a> this weekend after realising that it doesn't need a ground connection to trigger anything (Unlike my <a href="http://makeymakey.com" target="_blank">Makey Makey</a>). This means that you can interact with the device so much more naturally, you can have installations that are interactive; that don't need you to touch two points for something to work; to complete a circuit.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-299 size-full" src="/assets/imgs/DSCF1811.jpg" alt="ototo" width="1200" height="800" /> Since Ototo uses batteries, most of the simple applications of it can be self contained, making experimenting with ideas quick as heck!</p>
<p>After playing around with Ototo for the last day – I feel that using Makey Makey's in schools (namely <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code club</a>) limits the potential of whats possible. I spent the last 40 minutes making this random board sing to me when touched in particular areas. What makes this so nice is that I only have to tap it and it works. No extra wires, no computer (in fact, the Ototo having batteries is such a bonus).</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-298 size-full" src="/assets/imgs/DSCF1809.jpg" alt="ototo" width="1200" height="800" /> Using copper tape and painting over it to experiment with how conductive it is. Conductive paint is expensive, so using it for testing can rack up some costs that aren't needed yet.</p>
<p>I've seen other companies work with the Ototo, taking the software and expanding it out to have it's own sound bank, I'll see if this is possible, i'm hoping that the software is Open Source. But sat in the garden right now, i'm not 100% sure it is.</p>
<p>Lets find out...</p>
