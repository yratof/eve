<p>Today, I started learning <a title="Rubt on Rails Officail Website" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on rails</a>. My initial thoughts were, "It seems simple enough to grasp". After spending a whole day installing and reinstalling 'gems' and updating out of date 'OpenSSL' things, I realised that maybe it won't be as simple as it seems.</p>
<p>I have three projects on my list that i want to tackle with RoR [Ruby on Rails], all of which aren't huge projects, but are things that have some significant value to me. The general theme of these sites are:</p>
<ol>
<li>EyeVersusEye - Fun way of pushing your ideas further</li>
<li>Framerates - Hand Picked Photographer Collective</li>
<li>Tutorials(wip) - Tutorials, but very niche</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why learn RoR when you already know some PHP? Why not continue with PHP?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, I don't want to learn php. My friends know php, but they've been developing for it for years, so they're far more advanced than i am, and more than I've ever be. I've come to accept this. I'm sick of having to depend on them when I need something building. I don't like waiting for something to happen: The worst scenarios are when i'm passionate about building a website, but the coders &amp; developers aren't, so they don't put the sameÂ enthusiasm into the project as i do, which usually ends up with messy code, or bug galore and features that aren't even there.</p>
<p>Ruby might be the first step in learning how to build full on systems myself, and tailor them to how i wanted in the first place. I'll be using all the tutorials i can get, and hopefully, in a few days, i'll have something to say about where i am with it.</p>
