So i've been working with procreate more and more recently, which has lead me down this path of creating brushes for almost niche illustrators and for specific purposes

**Mezzotint shader:** [gum.co/pwhgY](gum.co/pwhgY) – That grainy gradient that you see in contemporary illustration, used as brush, smudge or eraser, it helps you give a stylistic touch to flat illustrations. Works really well with geometric shapes, requires some work with angling. The brush gives you gradients with mezzotint to work with.

**Halftone shader:** [gum.co/PSOoy](gum.co/PSOoy) – I'm a fan of halftone. Ever since I got into Ashley Woods illustrations many years ago, since then, i've tried to use halftone in most of the illustration work I've done. I've tried to make some that aren't just your average pattern so you can get a nice realistic feel.

**Ballpoint pen:** [gum.co/dECwE](gum.co/dECwE) – Needed a pen for doodling and quick drawing. This pen can be used for writing too, but by hand writing is either written for a children's book or illegible, so I use this strictly for drawing

**Victore brush:** [gum.co/hkEH](gum.co/hkEH) – Another illustrator i'm a fan of, James Victore, he's got a wicked hand when it comes to nice big painted, inked, don't give a damn strokes. Often used for typography, but gives out a Japanese brush feel when used with drawing.

**Pilot parallel pen:** [gum.co/IDAsd](gum.co/IDAsd) – Another brush inspired by Ashley Wood, this pen requires you to move around the iPad a bit more than you would... or move the iPad around a bit more. When you want those angles and that choppy thick line work, you can use this with the halftone to make some great comic work

**Watercolours:** [gum.co/GgLec](gum.co/GgLec) – I spent a while just painting with inks and watercolours, trying to understand how to make the same effects in Procreate. I'm determined to carry on develop these brushes, hence why these ones aren't free - but i'm trying to find a solution for bleeding inks together, softening the inner stroke and giving that realistic feel to the brushes. So far, there are around 23 brushes here, I've got ~50 in total i'm working with, each being tweaked and realised when I'm happy with them.

So yeah, if you end up downloading any of them, please, play around, reply to this thread, tweet me yratof. I'd love to see what can be done with what I've made :)
