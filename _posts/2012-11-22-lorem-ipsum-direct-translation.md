To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it. Or desires to obtain pain in the bullet train to find fault with in the pleasure of pain that produces no resultant good to flee. These cases are perfectly account of the system, the fault of those who are in the original text: this is to sink.</p>
<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of ​​denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and a complete account of the system, and the very fact which is the truth, the master builder of a happy life by him who discovered it were said to you here. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because of the great sorrows of those who pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that they do not know. Nor again is there anyone who loves pain itself, because it is pain, pursue, so blinded by desire, but because occasionally occur at times of such a nature in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>
<p>User editable look and dislike men who are most worthy of hatred just to accuse and to appease with a ready pleasant flattery of her or else he can not foresee the pain and trouble that sint occaecati ambition, and equal blame belongs to those who forsake the duties of weakness of will, that is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. For your own responsibility to adhere to these terms is the option of choosing a less and when nothing prevents we may be able to do that which is well pleasing in the highest degree, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and debts or obligations, or of things it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. Accordingly, these matters to this a free hour, so that either rejecting some other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse consequences pains.</p>
