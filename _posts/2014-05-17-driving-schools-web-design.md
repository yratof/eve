<h2>The two apparently, don't mix.</h2>
<p>I've been spending time, on and off, for the last few years, developing a 'better' website for my dad who has been a driving instructor now for 10+ years. I always get about 60% of the way through the design, then have to take on other work. When i come back to the design, i don't like it.</p>
<p>The websites for the other driving schools in this area are laughable! Take a look <a href="http://ridings-som.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.mansfield-driving-schools.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.drivinglessonsmansfield.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.passwithpassport.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a> and you'll see what I mean. In fact, I have <strong>never</strong> seen a driving school website that is nice. <strong>Ever</strong>.</p>
<p>It must be one of those professions where everything is literally word of mouth. I know the big player in England has a website that's acceptable - "BSM" - but that's because it's a huge company that's got money to pour into it.</p>
<h3>But what about the little guys? What about the '<em>underdogs</em>' of the driving school world?</h3>
<p>When <a title="Naomi Atkinson Design" href="http://naomiatkinsondesign.com/" target="_blank">Naomi Atkinson</a> spoke at <a title="New Adventures in Web Design" href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/" target="_blank">NAconf</a> in January, she showed a brief that her team completed for .net magazine for "The Milk Man". Something that we all used to have, but in this modern time, have neglected ( Due to supermarkets being kings ). Brought into a modern era of technology. THAT is what I'd like to do for my dad.</p>
<p><a title="Driving Lessons in Mansfield" href="http://maunvalleysom.co.uk/" target="_blank">Maun Valley School Of Motoring</a></p>
<p>Something modern, Something that makes it easier for him? Something that can book lessons through the site? is that what I'd need? I know SEO is a massive thing that he needs...</p>
<p>The design changes on a weekly basis until something sticks, at the moment, nothing has stuck.</p>
<p>Do you have any examples of Driving School website that are decent?</p>
